Hi thereüëã I‚Äôm Wenda Shi, PhD student at [AiDLab (PolyU)](https://www.aidlab.hk/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Calvin Wong](https://www.aidlab.hk/en/people-detail/prof-calvin-wong) and [Dr. Xingxing Zou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UhnQA3UAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

Recently, I'm fortunate to work closely with [Yiren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=L2YS0jgAAAAJ) and [Dr. Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=SmL7oMQAAAAJ). My research interests focus on GenAI in fashion and design, including post-training of 2D/3D generative models.

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss, collaborate, or say hello. üòä
